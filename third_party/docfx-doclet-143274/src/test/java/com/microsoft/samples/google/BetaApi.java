/**
 * Indicates a public API that can change at any time, and has no guarantee of API stability and
 * backward-compatibility.
 *
 * <p>Usage guidelines:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>This annotation is used only on APIs with public visibility. Internal interfaces should not
 *       use it.
 *   <li>This annotation should only be added to new APIs. Adding it to an existing API is
 *       considered API-breaking.
 *   <li>Removing this annotation from an API gives it stable status, assuming the API doesn't have
 *       other annotations denoting instability.

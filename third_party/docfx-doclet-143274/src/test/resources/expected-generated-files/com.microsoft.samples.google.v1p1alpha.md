## This package is not the latest GA version! 

 For this library, we recommend using the [package](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-apikeys/latest/com.microsoft.samples.google.v1) associated with API version v1 for new applications.

## Prerelease Implications

This package is a prerelease version! Use with caution.
Each Cloud Java client library may contain multiple packages. Each package corresponds to a published version of the service.
We recommend using the latest stable version for new production applications, which can be identified by the largest numeric version that does not contain a suffix.
For example, if a client library has two packages: `v1` and `v2alpha`, then the latest stable version is `v1`.
If you use an unstable release, breaking changes may be introduced when upgrading.

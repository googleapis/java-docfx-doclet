## JavaDoc Doclet for DocFX for Google

Designed to generate YAML files from Javadoc output for DocFX consumption. While the doclet helps output docfx yml, there are some differences in the way Google needs this outputed to align with the other languages and look appropriate on [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference). 

The original github repository for the doclet can be found at [github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet).

This doclet is forked from release [143274](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-doclet/releases/tag/143274) from June 2020 as it is still compatible with DocFX V2.
